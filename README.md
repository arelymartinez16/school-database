# CMP168 School Database

## Description

I created the school database project during the spring semester of freshman year. This project aims to efficiently manage school-related data and interact with users through a menu system. The project is designed to handle school-related data, including information about courses, faculty, staff, and students. Throughout the project, I applied and extended my understanding of object-oriented programming principles and file I/O. 

### Key Features

- Read from file (the path and filename should be “SchoolDB_Initial.txt”)
- Display the plain text file content on the console
- Create the Objects as specified from the file content
- Create 3 new Course objects based on input
- Create 3 new Faculty objects based on input
- Create 3 new GeneralStaff objects based on input
- Create 3 new Student objects based on input
- Add 2 new Courses to a Faculty object
- Add 2 new Courses to a Student object
- Get the Course at index (valid and invalid indexes) from a Faculty object
- Get the Course at index (valid and invalid indexes) from a Student object
- Determine which Faculty object teaches the most and the least courses.
- Display all the Objects using toString on the console (this includes existing plus recently added)
- Write all of the Object details to a plain text output file using the same format as the input file
